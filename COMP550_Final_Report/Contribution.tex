\section{Statement of Contribution}
All members contributed to the project's design. Zihan Wang coded the BiLSTM\_A model and code frame, selected the initial pre-trained word2vec model, drew figures, and proofread the report. Jack Wei coded LR and LSTM models, fixed bugs, coded for running experiments, ran experiments, and wrote results and discussion sections. Xijuan Sun found the final pre-trained word2vec model, adapted the LSTM model for it, ran experiments, and wrote the first four sections of the report.
